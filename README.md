## Frameworks and Dependencies

First of all, install Node.js on your machine. [Node.js Installation](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

We are using a Decentralized App framework called [Truffle](https://truffleframework.com/). To install `truffle`, open your terminal/command prompt and run the command `npm install -g truffle`

We are using a `truffle box`. Which is basically a `truffle` project coupled with other frameworks and dependencies such as [React](https://reactjs.org/), [UPort](https://www.uport.me/) and bunch of other stuff such as `Webpack`, `react-router`, `redux`, and `redux-auth-wrapper`. 

You can install [Truffle React-UPort Box](https://truffleframework.com/boxes/react-uport) by running first cloning our project `git clone https://github.com/ishanjoshi02/Project-INK.git`, then `cd Project-INK` and then, just run `npm install`  

## UML Diagrams and Documentation

We are still working on documenting our project.
